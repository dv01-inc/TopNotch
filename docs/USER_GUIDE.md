# Detailed Users' Guide

There are four components to TopNotch: plans, assertions, diffs, and views. All plans and commands are specified in JSON files.
 
There are separate JSON files for the plan and each command. The plan's commands list specifies the order in which commands are run, the input and output to each command, and where to find the files for each command. Each command file specifies the data manipulation and qc logic of the command. 
 
The following list describes each component in-depth and demonstrates how to write the JSON files for each of these components.

## How To Run TopNotch
1. Run the script using ```bin/TopNotchRunner.sh --planPath (location of your plan)```
1. Go to the driver's web UI to monitor your job.
1. Your job's logs will print to stdout.
1. The script has the following exit codes
    * 0 - The fractionInvalid is less than every threshold for every assertion
    * 3 - The fractionInvalid is greater than every threshold for at least one assertion
    * 4 - The command line arguments were specified incorrectly.
1. Please note that plans and command json files can be parameterized with variables passed in through the command line. See the Variables section of this page for more information.

## Plan
The _Plan_: This specifies an ordered sequence of commands. Subsequent commands in the _plan_ can depend on the outputs of previous ones. The user can have zero, one, or any greater number of operations of each type of views, diffs, and assertions. There must be at least one operation.

The plan has two main components
1. io: An object that specifies where the the assertion reports should be written to. This can be HBase, a file on HDFS, or a server. The following points show how to set all possible values of io.
    - HBase - the reports will be written to the TopNotch table, reports column family, and qualifier column family. To change this location, you must change the values in the TnHBaseWriter object in src/main/scala/com/bfm/topnotch/tnengine/TnWriter.scala.
    ```javascript
    "io": {
        "writer": "hbase"
      }
    ```
    - HDFS without directory specification - the reports will be written to the topnotch folder in the user's home directory on HDFS
    ```javascript
    "io": {
        "writer": "hdfs"
      }
    ```
    - HDFS with directory specification
    ```javascript
    "io": {
        "writer": "hdfs"
        "dest": "/user/testUser/"
      }
    ```
    - REST - the reports will be sent as a PUT request to the URL specified, with the outputKey for the report's assertion command appended to the end of the URL
    ```javascript
    "io": {
        "writer": "rest"
        "dest": "http://www.testurl.com"
      }
    ```  
1. commands: A list that specifies which commands to run. The commands will be run sequentially in the order specified in the commands list.
    - There is a different format for specifying each of the types of commands. The section on commands explains how to specify each type of command.  
#### Sample Plan

## Commands
### How To Refer To Commands In a Plan
#### Input
Specify each input data set using an object. This can either be a data set from disk or the result of a previous command.
  * Mandatory Arguments:
    * ref - The string the refers to the data set. If reading from disk, this should be the location of the file on disk. If it is the output of a prior command, ref should be the outputKey of the command who produced the data set.
      * type - string
      * example value - "priorCommandKey"
    * onDisk - A boolean for whether loading a file off disk or reading the result of a previous command. If reading a file from disk, set to true. If input is the result of a previous command, set to false
      * type - boolean
      * example value - true
  * Optional Arguments
    * delimiter - Set this option if and only if the input is a csv, tsv, or other character-delimited file instead of a Parquet file. This string is the delimiter used in the input file. Do not use this field if reading in a Parquet file. This string must contain a single character.
      * type - string
      * example value - ","
#### Assertion:
  * Mandatory Arguments:
    * command - specifies that the command is of type assertion
      * type - string

    * input - specifies the input to the assertion
      * type - object
      * example value - see the above section on how to specify input
    * outputKey - This value should be globally unique. It provides a key for referring to the output of this assertion at a later step in the plan.

      * example value - "location/on/hdfs" (NOTE: path is on HDFS and relative to user's HDFS home directory unless it starts with /)
    * cache - Store the output of this command in RAM. If this is set to true, the results of this command will be stored in RAM after the first time that they are written to disk or referred to by a later command. If cache is not specified or set to false, the output of this command will be recomputed each time it is used.
      * type - boolean
      * example value - true
    * tableName - Mount the output of this command as a table for access through SparkSQL. This can only be set if outputPath is also set.

      * type - object with two keys
        1. joinColumns - The columns from input1 to use when joining input1 with input2. Columns in joinColumns for input1 and input2 will be joined based on order. The first column in each joinColumns array will be joined on, then the second one in each array, etc. Therefore, it is possible to join columns with different names. The only requirements are that the two joinColumns arrays have the same number of values and that they both have at least one value.
          * type - array of strings, where each string is a column name.
          * example value - ["loanID", "poolNum"] 
        2. diffColumns - The columns from input1 to compare with the columns from input2. Columns in diffColumns for input1 and input2 will be compared based on order. The first column in each diffColumns array will be diffed, then the second one in each array, etc. Therefore, it is possible to diff columns with different names. The only requirement are that the two diffColumns arrays have the same number of values and that they both have at least one value.
          * type - array of strings
          * example value - ["loanBal", "loan_age", "balance"]

        ]
      }
       ```
    * input2Columns - specifies the columns from input2 to join on and to diff with input1. It has the same structure as input1Columns. See the above documentation on input1Columns.
  * Optional Arguments: 
    * thresholds - The thresholds to use for each column when determining if numeric values are equal. By default, this is 1e-6 for all columns. This overrides the the threshold argument optionally provided in the plan for each diff command. This argument has no effect of non-numeric columns. 
      * type - array of doubles
      * example value - [1.0, 2, 10000]
  * Example of How to Write an Diff JSON File

             "loanBalOld",
             "loan_age",
             "balance"
           ]
         }
       }
    ```
    
#### View:
  * Mandatory Arguments:
    * tableAliases - Aliases for how the query should refer to the inputs passed in through the plan. Each alias is a table that can be used in the query. The aliases are matched to the inputs based order, so that the first alias refers to the first input, the second alias to the second input, etc. There must be the same number of aliases as inputs.
      * type - array of strings
      * example value - ["loanData", "oldLoanData"]
    * query - The sql query to run that produces a new data set.
      * type - string
      * example value - "select * from loanData inner join oldLoanData on loanData.cusip = oldLoanData.cusip"

  * Example of How to Write an View JSON File
    ```javascript
    {
      "tableAliases": [
        "loanData",
        "oldLoanData"
      ],
      "query": "select * from loanData inner join oldLoanData on loanData.cusip = oldLoanData.cusip"
    }
    ```
    
## Variables
1. Any part of any command or plan can contain a variable. Just add ${variableName} in the key or value of any JSON.
1. Pass in a dictionary that defines values for the variables using the --variableDictionary flag.
1. Below is an example for how to parameterize an input to an assertion using the date and product type is:
  * Command line argument: --variableDictionary="date=$(date +%D),productType=mtg"
  * Input example:
  ```
  "input": {
    "ref": "topnotch/${productType}-${date}.parquet",
    "onDisk": true
  }
  ```
